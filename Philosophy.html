                <p>The philosophical and historical interpretations have been numerous and changing throughout history.
                    Marsilo Ficino, a 15th century Italian scholar and priest, was cited as saying, "The torture of Prometheus
                     is the torment brought by reason itself to man, who is made by it many times more unhappy than the brutes. 
                     It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light [...] that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and 
                     [...] only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge."
                </p>
